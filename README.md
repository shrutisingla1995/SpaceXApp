# SRR Setup (Server side rendering)
The server has delivered a completely static HTML page with all elements in pure SSR.
1. `ng add @nguniversal/express-engine --clientProject SpaceXapp`
2. `npm run dev:ssr`

Available on:
http://localhost:4201/

Varying sizes of icons inside the assets/icons directory

2. Configure Production Build with http-server
`npm install -g http-server`
3. Build the app for production environment
`npm build --prod`
4. Serve the angular PWA using the http-server
`cd dist/SpaceXapp`
5. Start the prod build
`http-server -o`
